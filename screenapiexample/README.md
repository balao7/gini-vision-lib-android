Screen API Example App
=========================

The Screen API example app provides you with a sample usage of the Gini Vision Library's Screen API activities.

The Gini API SDK is used for analyzing documents and sending feedback.

The `ReviewActivity` and `AnalysisActivity` extend the activities with the same name from the Gini Vision Library.

Before analyzing documents with the Component API example app, you need to set your Gini API Client Id and Secret in the `src/main/res/values/gini_api_credentials.xml`.
