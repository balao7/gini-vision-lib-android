Component API Example App
=========================

The Component API example app provides you with a sample usage of the Gini Vision Library's Component API fragments.

The Gini API SDK is used for analyzing documents and sending feedback.

You can find two activities using the Gini Vision Library's fragments. The `GiniVisionActivity` uses the standard activity and fragment classes provided by the system and the `GiniVisionAppCompatActivity` uses the Android Support Library's activity and fragment classes.

Before analyzing documents with the Component API example app, you need to set your Gini API Client Id and Secret in the `src/main/res/values/gini_api_credentials.xml`.
